        <h3>Synchronicity</h3>
        <p>
            Synchronicity is a concept co-created by Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Jung in the 1920s. They wanted to explore
            the gap between the recently discovered ideas of quantum mechanics and our understanding of the human mind.
            They believed their explorations could help develop the tools needed to examine the relationships between
            patterns in the universe across time. These could also be called coincidences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Say for instance you're walking down the sidewalk and a newspaper blows into your legs. You pick it up and
            you notice the name of a childhood friend you lost touch with has won an award. Some would see this as a
            sign, or maybe it's just a random coincidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course a rational explanation is that the human mind is somehow at a loss to determine whether an event
            occurred by random chance or for an explainable reason. A coincidence triggers some thought to occur that
            links two physically distant moments in time. In most situations we might not ever be able to rationally
            explain the event we witnessed. Although
            to a person experiencing the coincidence, these situations can have deep and impactful meaning. By
            extension, the coincidence may have huge consequences if some part of history depended on a coincidence
            occuring for a specific person.
        </p>

            There's an interesting relationship between evolution and coincidence. Evolution in nature needs randomness
            to progress. The universe essentially generates randomness at the lowest levels, and does so in discrete
            specific amounts of energy. How does evolution utilize randomness? It does so by creating the opportunity to
            'try out' infinite variations. I think it's reasonable to presume this is happening across the entire
            universe. Every galaxy is a giant pool of elementary particles, each one in a unique part of space and each
            with different amounts of particles than any other. Just one tiny variation in the configuration of a galaxy
            and the whole outcome changes dramatically over time. Galaxies can join and merge, creating larger galaxies!
            Gravity creates a connection between all the parts of the universe that respond to the gravitational field.
            This draws
            particles together, over time the particles clump up more and more and get bigger and more complex and
            dynamic. They get so heavy they start to crowd in on each other, forcing dynamic and strange interactions at
            high temperature and pressures. We get stars and planets, and asteroids, and blackholes. Yet somehow, out of
            all the variations in possible galaxies, humans popped out. Our minds seemingly able to do so many
            incredible things. We have such rich complex emotional lifes. People have a gravitational pull to one
            another. Not many people desire to live all of their lives alone. We've only sustained our species thus far
            through cooperation.

            Is it a coincidence that evolution and coincidence both require randomness?

            Life seems to require the ability to process information, and somehow use that information to enhance
            survival and reproduction. Understanding causalty is a natural task for us, because consciousness seems to
            draw a line between the present and the past. So why would consciousness feel causal? Either because the
            universe is causal, or because the universe is not causal, but representing the universe as causal has an
            evolutionary advantage. Information is the distillation of an input through computation. Of course the brain
            quickly managed to figure out how to encode huge amounts of information into a small format that could be
            managed and manipulated. Objects that our brain distinguishes are physically coupled, because for the most
            part that object stays physically coupled. For example if you shove someone, you effect their whole body. In
            reality our push imparts force at a specific point that ripples out to the rest of the body. Our brain
            interprets this as a single event, not constantly imagining the complete rippling event. It makes sense to
            interpret events and characterize them through comparison and contrast. If we think of measurement as the
            only way to gain information, then what are living things measuring? A microbe may be gathering and
            responding to chemical gradients in it's environment, whereas a person is measuring to deal with the
            complicated psycho-social world most of us live in.

            What types of reasoning involve a self, and a conception of a self?

            A self or an identification of the boundary where the world meets us. Us being the body and the mind
            existing within it. The mind is able to make decisions consciously. Learning evolved as a way to deal with a
            rapidly changing world. Imagination seems to be a key ingredient. Rote learning involves repeating a subject
            over and over until it is memorized. Associative learning is where we apply a concept from one situation to
            another different situation. As we practice with the concept, we can use it to establish our understanding
            of situations in which the concept would be helpful. Integral learning is where we build on a concept with
            an extension. Such as extending the concept of addition with multiplication. Strategies for gaining
            knowledge quickly are useful to life. Nature can massively distribute information throughout it's body to
            induce change. We are the only narrative based life.

            We are invariably going to need to reconcile various disciplines in order to explain the natural world.
            Moving towards the truth will require more and more resources.

            A theory of male domination in large societies.

            Why are most societies patriarchal in nature?

            Male humans cannot get pregnant. Female humans can. This distinction creates the core difference between men
            and women. It seems likely that this difference is a large factor in the creation of patriarchal societies.
            Large societies are responsible for managing resources to feed people, and women hold the power to create
            more people. Men are not forced by nature to raise young.
